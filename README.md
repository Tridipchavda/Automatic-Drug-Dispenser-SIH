# Automatic-Drug-Dispenser-SIH

Our <b>Team Atulya</b> had been selected for the Grand Finale of the <b>Smart India Hackathon 2023 Hardware Edition</b>. The team, led by Saurabh Panchal  , included Hetanshi Acharya  , Pranchal Goyal  , Amit Gohel  , and prasad mistry . 

Our Problem Statement was to develop an <b>Automatic Drug Dispenser</b> , for which we built hardware to solve the problem in combination with software. It would not have been possible without the unconditional support and guidance of <b>Dr Vinod Thummar</b>  and <b>Prof. Avni Dave</b> who gave their best to make this project reach where it did.

The Nodal Centre for our problem statement was <i>Manipal Institute of Technology,  Manipal, Karnataka</i>. The five-day-long hackathon was like a series of unexpected events. The entire organizing team of MIT was truly supportive. We never got to hear a "No" from the organizing team for any of the components we needed during the entire hackathon. Even the Jury dedicated to our problem statement was really patient and gave response in a very positive way.

The five days went like a roller coaster when our project kept undergoing drastic changes. However, our team came up with the best possible ideas to tackle the situation. The team worked day and night to make the best out of it.

Lastly, not the prize, but definitely the new experience, new memories, and the new learnings we won.
